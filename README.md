# No Vignette Yes Warning
![World Border Warning](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1122383983255228536/1122384560353710180/2023-06-25_13.31.15.jpg)
Remove the black vignette effect, but keep the world border warning effect!

## Compiling
To compile this mod, run the following command:
```
./gradlew build
```
The mod jar will be created in `./fabric/build/libs/` folder.

## Why does this mod use architectury?
I tried to make Forge version of the mod as well, but due to the excessive amount of tweaks in Forge, the mixin did not work very well.  
I am not a Forge user, so I don't care honestly.
